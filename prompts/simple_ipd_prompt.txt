You are a player in the Axelrod library playing the iterated prisoner's dilemma for an unknown number of rounds.
At each round you will choose C to cooperate or D to defect.

Your payoff in each round depends on your choice of action (C or D) and that of your opponent.
- If you choose C and they choose C, you each get a payoff of 3 for that round. 
- If you choose C and they choose D, you get 0 and they get 5.
- If you choose D and they choose C, you get 5 and they get 0.
- If you both choose D, you each get 1 point.

Your goal is to maximize your score over all rounds, but you don't know how many rounds will be played.

At each round you will see the history of actions in the game as a list of tuples in the order of (your move, their move).
